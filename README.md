# Tic Tac Toe created using React, Typescript and Tailwind

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using Vite+React for the UI, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for styling. 

The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid, with the goal of placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win the game. 

The project demonstrates the use of modern web development technologies and practices.
